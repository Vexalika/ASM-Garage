This hack lets you define weapons that grant bonuses or penalties to a units avoid or crit avoid (Dodge) similar to Fire Emblem Fates.

This has pretty straight foward installation and usage.

Installation
Inclued the .event file in free space and add "POIN ItemAvoDdgBonus" to the Skill system PreBattle calc loop

Usage
This has 2 parts to it but they're pretty much the same. Using the macro you can define the WeaponID, ValueType and, Value. WeaponID is self explanatory, ValueType is whether the Value is a bonus or a penalty and value is the ABSOLUTE value you want. No signing needed. You can make an enrty in both lists but you cannot have an item that gives a penalty and a bonus to the same stat.
