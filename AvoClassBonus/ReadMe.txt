This hack changes the avoid calculation for an arbitrary list of classes. I personally use it with DSFE avoid by GratedShtick but it fuctions just fine in vanilla as the actual calculation add an extra bonus luck and speed.

This has pretty straight foward installation and usage.

Installation
Include "AvoClassBonus.Event" somwhere in free space and then configure in same file.

Usage
In "AvoClassBonus.Event" define what classes you want to have boosted Avo and the add "POIN AvoClassBonus" to the pre battle calc loop. On its own it does nothing though so you'll most likely use this in conjunction with changing the avoid formula. I recomend DSFE avoid by GratedShtick as thats what I made it for.
