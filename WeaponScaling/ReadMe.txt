This hack lets you define weapons that grant bonuses to attack based on a percentage of a stat.

This has pretty straight foward installation and usage.

Installation
Inclued the .event file in free space and add "POIN WeaponScaleBonus" to the Skill system PreBattle calc loop

Usage
Pick whatever weapon, stat and how much of that stat you want. The code accounts for the percent you put and will round out any weird splits. 65% will get you as close as it can with what is available.
